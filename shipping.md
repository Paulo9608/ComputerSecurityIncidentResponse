# Considerations for Security Assessment of Commercial Ships using NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5

1. Scope of Assessment:
   - Tailor the assessment to the unique characteristics of the ship and its operations.
   - Determine the boundaries and scope of the assessment.

2. Applicability of Controls:
   - Prioritize controls based on their relevance to the ship's operations and potential risks.
   - Determine which controls are applicable and feasible to implement on a commercial ship.

3. Compliance with Regulations:
   - Ensure that the security assessment is in compliance with applicable international and national regulations related to safety and security.

4. Collaboration and Coordination:
   - Establish clear communication channels and roles and responsibilities for all parties involved in the assessment.
   - Collaborate and coordinate with ship owners, operators, crew members, and regulatory bodies as necessary.

5. Risk Management:
   - Incorporate risk management principles into the security assessment to identify, assess, and prioritize risks based on their likelihood and impact.
   - Allocate resources effectively to mitigate the most critical risks.

6. Continuous Monitoring:
   - Establish mechanisms for continuous monitoring and improvement of security controls on a commercial ship.
   - Adapt NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 guidance on continuous monitoring and assessment of security controls to the context of a commercial ship.
